# Changes-to-Palindrome
This MapReduce code was submitted as part of an assignment for the Big Data: High-Performance Computing class offered through the M.S. Data Science program at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

The mapper and reducer for this short project will take the words of a text document and determine the fewest number of changes needed to make a palindrome.  The palindrome result may or may not be an actual word while changes include letter additions, subtractions, or substitutions in any order or combination.

Note: The mapper and reducer are both primed for Hadoop but may need to be copied and pasted into a VM file and resaved to secure proper spacing.
